/**
 @abstract The `ATLMCardResponse` class represents the response portion of a ATLMCard interaction.
 @discussion The `ATLMCardResponse` class is not intended to be subclassed.  Composition should
 be preferred over inheritance.  A `ATLMCardResponse`, much like a `ATLMCard` is a combination of a
 payload `LYRMessagePart` and a set of supplemental `LYRMessagePart` instances.  `ATLMCardResponse`
 does not allow for the creation of a standalone `LYRMessage`.  It only offers the ability to send
 in response to a particular `ATLMCard`. This guarantees the `ATLMCardResponse` is sent to the same
 conversation as the `ATLMCard` instance.
