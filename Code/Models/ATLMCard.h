/**
 @abstract The `ATLMCard` class is the base class implementation for rich, interactive cards.
 @discussion The `ATLMCard` class provides an API for rich, interactive cards via the Layer
 platform. This class is designed to be flexible enough to support various card "types" and
 behaviors but still enforces a strict compliance to a specific structure which `ATLMCard` expects
 and requires. Although `ATLMCard` can be used as a standalone, the expectation is that subclassing
 is used to create these other types of cards. E.g. a Poll card would be implemented as a subclass
 of `ATLMCard` with its own specialized implementation.
